    <div class='intro-container'><div class='sub-blog-intro' id='sahara-intro'>As a huge fan of both Shakespeare and pasta (and who isn't), I was stoked to finally
    come to Verona (setting of the amazing Shakespeare play <em>Romeo & Juliet</em> as well as the movie <em>Letters to Juliet</em>, which
    I unashamedly and unironically love), and later, I hoped, Bologna. Unfortunately, my Bologna plans didn't come through, but I had such a good
    time in Verona that I don't even care. A warm, walkable, tiny town filled with the nicest people, sweetest gelato and best pasta in all of
    Italy (I'm convinced), Verona is well worth your while.</div></div>

        <div class='time-body' id='time-body1-sahara'>First throughts: Verona is <em>hot</em>. I'm dressed in a turtleneck, dark jeans and Timbs, as an American does
        in an unforgiving European March, but it is easily over 75 degrees outside. As soon as I check into my hotel, I change into the one dress I brought on this solo trip and then head straight
        into the city for lunch. </div>

        <div class='time' id='time2-sahara'>2 PM /</div>
        <div class='time-body' id='time-body2-sahara'>After a lovely 20 minute walk into the city center, I debate different options for lunch, eventually eschewing real food altogether for gelato instead.
        Solid choice, I must say. I also stop by a Bershka to pick up the cheapest (5€) t-shirt I can find. If it's going to be as warm here tomorrow, I need to be prepared.</div>

        <div class='time' id='time3-sahara'>5 PM /</div>
        <div class='time-body' id='time-body3-sahara'>I spent a solid three hours just wandering around aimlessly. I made a beeline to Juliet's balcony, which is a big part of the aforementioned
        <em>Letters to Juliet</em> movie, before making my way to Castelvecchio Bridge, by far Verona's biggest landmark, where a Romanian Instagram model insisted on taking photos of me for my parents,
       making sure she got #all #the #angles.</div>

        <div class='time-body' id='time-body4-sahara'>I'm exhausted from my six-hour bus ride and it looks like the sun is setting soon, so I embark on a quest for pasta. A TripAdvisor review convinces me that
         this one to-go pasta place near Castelvecchio Bridge has the best pasta in the city, and I happily grab a cup (yes, a cup) of Pasta alla Norma to go.</div>

        <div class='time' id='time5-sahara'>7 PM /</div>
        <div class='time-body' id='time-body5-sahara'>This pasta is literally incredible. I scarf down the entire thing in about five minutes and chat with my mom about how things are going
        back home. She's worried about me, since this is my first time traveling alone, but she's secretly proud, I can tell.</div>

      <div class='time-body' id='time-body1-sahara'>I wake up early-ish and head down to the lobby for breakfast. So far, these European hotel breakfasts have not disappointed, and this one doesn't either. Because this is my first solo trip, and because I knew for a long time I wanted to do this solo trip, I saved up a little extra money from my job to stay at hotels, rather than AirBnBs.
      Considering the fact that I planned a two-week trip with all the hotel and transportation costs under $600 (thank you easyJet and Flixbus), I feel like I didn't end up spending that much.</div>

      <div class='time' id='time2-sahara'>10 PM /</div>
      <div class='time-body' id='time-body2-sahara'>Time to head back to the city! I don't really have an agenda today, but I found a museum of Roman architecture and ruins on the very north end of the city that I want to check out. Before I start heading in that direction, though, I stop for some gelato. Yes, it's 10:00 a.m. But is there anything in the world that tastes as good as 10:00 a.m. gelato?</div>
    </div>

    <div class='sub-container' id='sub-container-3'>
      <div class='time' id='time3-sahara'>1 PM /</div>
      <div class='time-body' id='time-body3-sahara'>That museum was incredible! I'm a museum person anyway, but history museums (i.e. museums with ruins and artifacts) are my favorite. I didn't know that Verona had such a storied Roman-history past! I spent close to three hours in that museum and loved every second of it. Pro tip: George Ezra is the perfect museum music.</div>

      <div class='time' id='time4-sahara'>2 PM /</div>
      <div class='time-body' id='time-body4-sahara'>After leaving the museum, I headed to a tiny restaurant I found on TripAdvisor the night before. The reviews mentioned that the spinach gnocchi was amazing, so that's what I ordered. The owners of the restaurant were the nicest old couple, and they recommended a truly excellent glass of chianti to go with my lunch. I spent
      an hour in the restaurant reading my solo trip book (<em>We Were the Lucky Ones</em> by Georgia Hunter). It was divine.</div>

    <div class='sub-container' id='sub-container-5'>
      <div class='time' id='time5-sahara'>4 PM /</div>
      <div class='time-body' id='time-body5-sahara'>After two more hours of just wandering around Verona, walking along the river and through the cutest little streets (I also picked up a bottle of Limoncello for my friend, who I'm seeing in a couple days in Geneva), I found a cafe on the main square and settled into reading- and people-watching-mode. Full disclosure,
       I almost got another gelato, but decided to be responsible (for once).</div>
    </div>

    <div class='sub-container' id='sub-container-6'>
      <div class='time' id='time6-sahara'>6 PM /</div>
      <div class='time-body' id='time-body6-sahara'>Once it started to get dark, I stopped by the same to-go pasta place and picked up a cup of cacio e pepe (also <em>amazing</em>). I called my mom for a few minutes (remember to call your mom and/or dad, guys!) before finishing up some work. I headed to bed at around 10:00 p.m., ready for my early morning trian tomorrow — to Milan!</div>
