        <div class='subheader-guides' id='subheader-ldn'>No city is as close to my heart as London. I've had some of the best times of my life in this city, but perhaps more importantly, it is here that I discovered
        who I am, truly. The former seat of empire certainly has an intimidating quality, but Londoners are on average some of the friendliest people I've encountered, though not without a smattering of classic
        British pessimism. If you've just moved to London, pop down to your neighborhood pub to meet your new neighbors. If you're in London for a quick vacation (though no amount of time will ever be enough to do London
        justice), I hope this short guide below proves helpful as you plan your trip.</div>

              London is not London without Indian food, and no Indian spot is as storied as Dishoom, with its unparalleled breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pair dinner with one of their many excellent cocktails, and breakfast with bottomless chai. With an expansive menu and limitless drink options, Dishoom can please any palate.</div>

            <div class='suggestion-text' id='ldn-text-suggestion'><div id='ldn-text-2'>
              The feta cheesecake at any of Honey & Co.'s restaurants is the stuff of dreams, but every menu item is perfection. Founded by former Ottolenghi head chefs, Honey & Co. is almost unparalleled in its mastery of modern Mediterranean cuisine. Perhaps one of the more unexpected spots for breakfast, Honey & Co. simply cannot be beat.

              This tiny food stand in East London's <a href='https://www.spitalfields.co.uk/' id='ldn-links' class='link-guides'>Spitalfields Market</a> is a must-stop on any food tour of London. With fresh-made dumplings and noodles, Dumpling Shack is easily one of the best lunches (or midday snack stops!) in the city — and it'll knock you back only £10.

              The Ned's Library Bar is the epitome of Old-World London. Tucked in a corner of The Ned's expansive lobby, Library Bar is cozy and small, perfect for intimate conversations. Order from the excellent cocktail menu or take advantage of Library Bar's bespoke table service and create your own martini, mixed in front of you.

              Eschew the overdone The Shard for Sky Garden instead. Offering impressive views of the London cityscape from the city's highest aerial garden, City Bar's vibe cannot be beat. Sip one (or three!) of City Bar's botanical-themed cocktails while watching the sun sink over the Thames.

            The Blind Pig, a Social Eating House project, routinely tops the list of London's best cocktail bars — not an easy feat. Start off your night with pre-theater drinks at The Blind Pig, head upstairs for a Michelin-starred dinner at Social Eating House, followed by a West End Musical — then come back for a post-theater nightcap.

            <div class='suggestion-text' id='ldn-text-suggestion'><div id='ldn-text-7'>
              Mandarin Oriental's Hyde Park hotel has seen more than its fair share of esteemed guests. Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill used to check in to the hotel often, and both Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth II took dance lessons here. The Mandarin Oriental is unquestionably a London institution, opulent but fresh and light at the same time.

            <div class='suggestion-text' id='ldn-text-suggestion'><div id='ldn-text-8'>
              Steps from the British Museum, the Bloomsbury Hotel proves that you don't have to sacrifice luxury for convenience. Although Bloomsbury has a reputation as a "college town," as the neighborhood is home to some of London's many universities, the Bloomsbury Hotel is most certainly not a college institution — it's luxury in the beating heart of the city.

              The Goring Hotel, a century-old family-owned hotel in one of West London's poshest neighborhoods, is the epitome of British luxury — elegant, intimate and with exceptional service. Join the crème de la crème of London high society as they pop by for a spot of tea or a drink in the Goring's gold-trimmed bar.
